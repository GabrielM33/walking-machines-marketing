## Hook Variation 1: Mind-blowing Fact Approach

**Hook Script (4 seconds):**

```
China just hosted the world's first robot boxing match.
Two Unitree G1 humanoids throwing actual punches.
But here's the crazy part...
They're learning to fight in real-time.
```

**Visual Suggestions:**

- **Title Text**: "ROBOTS BOXING IN CHINA"
- **Visual**: Close-up of robot fist making contact, slow-motion punch impact, crowd reactions
- **Triple Threat**: Dramatic punch sounds + slow-mo impact + bold text overlay

**Full Opening (10-15 seconds):**

```
China just hosted the world's first robot boxing match. Two Unitree G1 humanoids throwing actual punches. But here's the crazy part... They're learning to fight in real-time. Every dodge, every counter-punch is being calculated mid-fight. This isn't pre-programmed choreography...
```

**Hook Analysis:** Uses mind-blowing fact (first robot boxing match) → scroll stop with "But here's the crazy part" → contrarian snapback about real-time learning vs. expectations of pre-programming.

## Hook Variation 2: Metaphor Approach

**Hook Script (4 seconds):**

```
Remember Rocky vs. Apollo Creed?
Now imagine both fighters are robots.
But plot twist...
These machines hit harder than humans ever could.
```

**Visual Suggestions:**

- **Title Text**: "ROBOT ROCKY"
- **Visual**: Split screen of classic Rocky fight vs. robot boxing, impact comparison shots
- **Triple Threat**: Boxing bell sounds + side-by-side footage + movie reference text

**Full Opening (10-15 seconds):**

```

```

**Hook Analysis:** Uses familiar movie metaphor → establishes visual comparison → contrarian element about superior robot strength vs. human expectations.

## Hook Variation 3: Benefit/Pain Point Approach

**Hook Script (4 seconds):**

```
Everyone's scared AI will replace human jobs.
Well, they just replaced boxers too.
However...
This might actually save lives.
```

**Visual Suggestions:**

- **Title Text**: "AI REPLACES BOXERS"
- **Visual**: Human boxer vs. robot boxer comparison, medical imagery, safety statistics
- **Triple Threat**: Punching sounds + comparison footage + safety benefit text

**Full Opening (10-15 seconds):**

```
Everyone's scared AI will replace human jobs. Well, they just replaced boxers too. However... This might actually save lives. These Unitree G1 robots in China can simulate every aspect of combat sports without brain damage, concussions, or career-ending injuries...
```

**Hook Analysis:** Addresses common AI fear → confirms the fear → contrarian snapback about unexpected benefit (safety) rather than just replacement.

## Hook Variation 4: Common Ground Approach

**Hook Script (4 seconds):**

```
We've all seen robot videos that look fake.
Dancing, parkour, whatever.
But this changes everything...
These robots are actually fighting each other.
```

**Visual Suggestions:**

- **Title Text**: "REAL ROBOT COMBAT"
- **Visual**: Montage of "fake-looking" robot videos vs. genuine boxing footage
- **Triple Threat**: Skeptical tone + authentic footage + "REAL" emphasis text

**Full Opening (10-15 seconds):**

```
We've all seen robot videos that look fake. Dancing, parkour, whatever. But this changes everything... These robots are actually fighting each other. In China, two Unitree G1 humanoids just threw down in a legitimate boxing match with real strategy, real hits, real consequences...
```

**Hook Analysis:** Establishes shared skepticism about robot videos → validates that feeling → contrarian turn to authentic combat vs. perceived fakeness.
