Step 0: Psychology - Expectation (what people think is going to happen) vs Reality (what actually happens)

    - If expectation < reality: people are happy and continue watching
    - If expectation > reality: poeple churn

Do the following steps in order when writing a script:

Step 1: Packaging

    - Click Confirmation: Make sure the first few lines of the intro confirm, or ideally, beat their expectations set by the title
    E.g. Title: I Spent 100 Hours Inside the Pyramids!
    First minute: We explored rooms that have never been explored before.

    Idea:
    - A single compelling line that addresses a painpoint or sparks curiosity, pulling viewers into the loop.
    - Drags viewers into a rabit hole (the rest of the video)

    Title:
    - Having a clear title is essential before crafting the intro.
    - Trigger a click curiosity loop
    - Does the title create irresistible curiosity about the problem, making viewers eager to click?
    - What should viewers expect after clicking the video?

    Thumbnail:
    - The thumbnail can be flexible, no need to craft it before recording.

Step 2: Outline

    What makes a video good to great:
    - Unique perspective
    - Differentiated angle
    - Novel Information
    - Could your reality exceed expectations because you're that good?
        How :
         - Tip itself
         - Distillation process
         - Example used
         - Say something nobody else is saying (this will beat expectations)

    Tip: a quick bullet-point outline helps you check if you're sharing something valuable or just repeating common ideas.

    Before writing the script, go research more, go watch other source material and try to come up with more novel points.
