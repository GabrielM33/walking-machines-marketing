How To Become A Master Storyteller [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5Z-Q1bg1tU&ab_channel=Kallaway]

1. **The Dance**

   - Context → Conflict → Context → Conflict...
   - Improves retention
     How: Conflicts create open loops in the brain and context closes the loops
   - Use 'therefore' and 'but', don't use 'and then'
     E.g. This happens THEREFORE this happens, or, this happens BUT this happens

The wild world of Stanley cups #shorts [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/WDhcMbFFeVU]

Something crazy is happening with Stanley Cups.
You ever seen one of these Stanley Cups?

[B-roll]
This 40 ounce Stanley quencher has become the Louis Vuitton of drink wear.
it's a status symbol.
New releases are selling out in seconds.
People are flipping them for hundreds on eBay.
Stanley the company 10x its Revenue in 4 years off this single product.
BUT the real question is... How did they do it?
How did Stanley Cups go from a construction worker's thermos to the dream Christmas gift?
[B-roll]
I got a Stanley yay
[B-roll]
it's a wild story.
So in 2019, Stanley was actually about to discontinue the cup.
BUT this group of mom bloggers, @thebuyguide, knew they were making a huge mistake.
So they cut a special affiliate deal with Stanley to bulk order 5,000 cups, with a Twist.
Stanley had to make them pastel colors.
Those 5,000 cups, sold out in 5 days...
And completely changed their philosophy on design.
BUT it gets even better...
A few months ago, Stanley had the burning car moment.
It's a video of a woman's car completely charred with her Stanley Cup being the only thing that survived.

2. **Rhythm**

   - Use a variety of sentences and syllable combinations to create an unpredictable rhythm.

   “This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety.

   Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important.

   So write with a combination of short, medium, and long sentences. Create a sound that pleases the reader's ear. Don't just write words. Write music.”

   ― Gary Provost

3. **Tone**

   - Conversational tone, feels personal, builds trust
   - Film your videos as if you're talking to one close friend. Or 'dear son,'

4. **Direction**

   - Best way to write a story is by starting with the end, then the hook, and lastly the story in between
   - Use the last line as a setup for the first line to create a loop
   - When writing a script, think:
     - Where do you want to take the viewer?
     - What do you want to leave them with?
     - What should be the last thing they hear?

5. **Storylenses**

   - Add your unique angle or spin on a particular story
     E.g. When a Snoop Dog watched a Botafogo game at the Club World Cup, lots of people talked about him wearing a Botafogo jersey and him joking with Meireles, no one talked about how the CWB is making Brazilian clubs get global visibility, that would be a great angle for content.

6. **The Hook**

   - First line should be as punchy and indicative of what's to come as possible.

   [Example] Best Garden Techniques
   Do's

   - These are the best gareden techniques for "\_".
   - I've got these garden techniques.
   - This is the garden technique that you should study.

   Dont's

   - Wait until you see this.
   - You're not gonna believe this.

   [Example]

   **First line shoud immediately grab the viewers attention**

   **Visual hooks are 10x more effective than audio hooks.**
