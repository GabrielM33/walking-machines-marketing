How to Create Irresistible Hooks [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmXpbP7dD48&t=572s&ab_channel=Kallaway]

Goal: Make a user stop scrolling the feed and watch your video.

How: Curiosity loop.

- Your hook should be so interesting that they can’t stop watching the first line, then the second line, then the third… (Domino effect)

The Hook Formula:

1. Topic Clarity: Clearly define what the video is about.

1. Context Lean: Draw the audience in by leaning on relatable scenarios.

   - Establish common ground
   - Reference a benefit or pain point
   - Use a metaphor to simplify a complex idea
   - Share something mind-blowingly interesting

1. Scroll Stop Interjection: a single line meant to act like a stun gun/as if the user ran into a wall/uno reverser card.

   - How: using contrasting words (e.g., but, however, although, yet, therefore, on the other hand…)

1. Contrarian Snapback: A sentence that goes in the opposite direction of the initial lean.

   - E.g., If you want to achieve X don’t do Y, do Z, and if you want to achieve X you’re going to listen. (you need Z to be compelling)

1. Visual Hooks: are key, they are more powerful than spoken word hooks.

   - Title text will make your videos perform better.
     - Put 3-5 words on the screen in bold font to help build context lean
   - Use the most compelling visual possible with enough motion to hold attention.
   - Spoken word + Motion + Text on Screen = Virality

1. People Like Hearing Things They are Already Interested In

   - But they are open to hearing new perpectives on it if they think that new perpective will unlock a benefit or solve a pain point that they have in the category.

1. Cult Hopping: Using a known brand, celebrity, movement, or cultural reference as a metahpor to support/dumb down/establish common ground your point.

   - Draft off the credibility and popularity of something that already exists.

1. Compress Speed to Value: Front loa the value as much as possible.

   - You’ve got about 4 seconds before no one pays attention to it.
   - Give a little bit of value either in the hook or right after the hook.
   - Give context → Give value → Give context → Give value → \*\*\*\*Repeat

1. Make Your Hook Sentences Sticcato: Short and punchy

- Increase the density of value per word in the beggining
- Expand to medium or longer as the video extends

10. Get the Reps In: Iterate and learn and improve
    - The next video should always be better than the previous

Title: The Las Vegas Sphere Has Insane Tech #shorts

Script:
[Topic Clarity] The tech in the Vegas sphere is insane.

Biggest screen ever built.

[Context Lean] 20 times bigger than an IMAX.

[Contrarian Injection] But get this…

The screen is actually the least impressive part of the whole thing because the most impressive part is the audio.

This is going to blow your mind…

The sphere has 167,000 speakers hidden behind the screen.

That's eight dedicated speakers per person.

And this is the wild part…

They built a system that can customize sound for every individual seat.

That means they can play audio in multiple languages at the same time for different parts of the venue.

You hear the concert in Spanish, I hear the concert in English at the same time…

Which is insane…

And they do this using the same engineering as noise cancelling headphones.

Now, don't get me wrong…

The visuals are also crazy, but it's not just the screen that makes the magical…

It's the camera.

The sphere is so huge and curved they had to invent the world's most powerful video camera just to film for it.

This was their first attempt…

11 Cinema cameras welded together.

But it was way too hard to sync up and edit…

So instead they invented this… the Big Sky.

Shoots in 18K, the footage is so big, 1 second takes up 60 GB of storage, that means 4 seconds fills up your iPhone.

They even had to build a secret minis sphere in California that's 1/4 the size just to test how the visuals would look.

It's pretty nuts.

Now, the second sphere is set to begin Construction in Abu Dhabi next year…

And I bet we'll see 10 of these by 2035.

Question is: who's going to be the first artist to run the sphere only World Tour.

[Hook Setup Example (for leads)]

There are three massive mistakes people are making with their mortgage.

The average person pays an extra $12,000 per year.

Now, most people think it’s because of high interest rates.

But it turns out, it has nothing to do with that.

Because the biggest waste of money is actually coming from…

[Hook Setup Example 2]

Today we’re talking about hooks.

If you want your videos to perform better, you have to make better hooks.

[Hook Setup Example 3]

If you want better sleep… [Leads with the benefit of talking about sleep/pain point]

You need to be taking magnesium. [Solution]
