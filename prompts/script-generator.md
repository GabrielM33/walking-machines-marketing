Prompt:
Goal: Craft a 15–30 sec YouTube Short script for Walking Machines (humanoid-robot niche) that maximizes retention and shareability.

Audience: Tech‑curious viewers & robot buffs (20–35 yrs) who crave “firsts” and mind‑blowing feats.

Length: ~90–100 words (~20-30 sec spoken using Eleven Labs).

Tone & Style:

High‑energy, cinematic, visceral (“you’re there”)

Use simple, punchy sentences

Lean on surprise and wonder (“you won’t believe…”)

Structure & Timing:

Hook (0–10 %, 0–3 sec): Instant intrigue—one line max, start mid‑action or with a jaw‑dropping fact.

Curiosity Gap / Story (10–70 %, 3–21 sec): Flesh out the “first” moment. Tease “how” or “why” without giving it away.

Reward (70–90 %, 21–27 sec): Reveal the payoff—what happened, how flawlessly it landed, why it matters.

CTA / Loop (90–100 %, 27–30 sec): End with a question or loopback that makes viewers rewatch or engage (“Guess how many tries?,” “Watch again to spot the moment,” “Follow for more robot firsts”).

The video idea for the script:

Hook:
This robot just nailed a perfect side flip—watch this!

Story:
This is Unitree's G1—150 pounds of metal and AI. It's about to rewrite robotics history with pure computational power. Watch as decades of engineering converge in one impossible moment.

Reward:
Incredible! Every calculation perfect, every movement fluid. This isn't just a robot anymore—it's an athlete. Mechanical precision meets artistic grace.

CTA:
Follow for more jaw‑dropping robot feats!
